# Plasma Metadata Schema (Plasma-MDS)
This public repository contains the schema and example files for Plasma-MDS.

## Aim

The Plasma Metadata Schema (Plasma-MDS) was developed to support the findability and reusability of research data in applied plasma physics and plasma medicine. So far, it is implemented in the [INPTDAT](https://www.inptdat.de/) data platform and the research data repository of the Research Department Plasmas with Complex Interactions at Ruhr Universität Bochum ([https://rdpcidat.rub.de](https://rdpcidat.rub.de/)).

This repository is intended to provide a way for collaborative advancement of the metadata schema by the community.
